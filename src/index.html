        <p>Docker is an open-source platform that enables developers to automate the deployment, scaling, and management of
        applications within lightweight, portable containers. Containers package an application and its dependencies, ensuring
        consistent performance across different environments
        1
        . Docker uses operating system-level virtualization to deliver software in packages called containers, which are
        isolated from one another and bundle their own software, libraries, and configuration files</p>

        Sysoev and publicly released in 2004.[9] Nginx is free and open-source software, released under the terms of the
        2-clause BSD license. A large fraction of web servers use Nginx,[10] often as a load balancer.[11]</p>
